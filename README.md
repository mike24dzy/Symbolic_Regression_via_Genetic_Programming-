# Symbolic_Regression_via_Genetic_Programming-
Using genetic programming techniques to find the corresponding expression for a given dataset

### This project uses genetric programming to explore methods for symbolic regression and finding the best fit expression of a given dataset (or curve). This project uses recursion and binary tree to encode the elements of the formula expression for a given dataset.
